# 🧾 Store Sales Analysis – Skillified Mentor Project

This project analyzes store-level features such as temperature, fuel price, promotions, CPI, and unemployment to understand patterns that may influence store sales performance.

## 🧠 Objective

To perform exploratory data analysis and basic modeling using store feature data to uncover:
- Promotion trends
- Temporal patterns
- Correlations between economic indicators and markdowns
- Insights that could help in planning sales strategies

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains:
- Store-level attributes
- Weekly timestamps
- Economic features like CPI & Unemployment
- Promotional markdowns (MarkDown1–5)
- Holiday indicators

**Note:** Actual `Weekly_Sales` is not included.

## 🔧 Workflow

1. **Data Loading**  
2. **Preprocessing**  
   - Convert dates  
   - Handle missing values  
   - Encode categorical variables  
3. **EDA**  
   - Weekly markdown trends  
   - Holiday impact  
   - Correlation heatmap  
4. **Basic Modeling**  
   - Simple Linear Regression using TotalMarkdown  
5. **Conclusion & Business Insights**
